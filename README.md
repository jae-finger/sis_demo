## Author: Jonathan Finger
### Date: 07/11/2020

## Summary
A demonstration of a basic student information system and interactive visualizations for one grade in a fictional school. All information is dummy and does not pertain to any real individual. The goal is to create a series of interactive and dynamic visualizations deployed as a web app. The anticipated stack is SQLdb -> python -> plotly -> flask -> heroku.

## Installation

Clone this repo and then navigate to the `sis_demo` directory.

## Setup

Initialize the `pipenv` in base directory.

## Usage

Launch the flask app using:

```sh
# Mac:
FLASK_APP=web_app flask run

# Windows:
# ? Export FLASK_APP=hello.py # one time set of environmental variable
# ? flask run
```
