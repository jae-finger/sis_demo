## Summary
A demonstration of a basic student information system and interactive visualizations for one grade in a fictional school. All information is dummy and does not pertain to any real individual. The goal is to create a series of interactive and dynamic visualizations deployed as a web app. The anticipated stack is SQLdb -> python -> plotly -> flask -> heroku.
